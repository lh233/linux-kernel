Linux内核内存管理的实现以struct page为核心，类似城市的地标（如上海的东方明珠），其他所有的内存管理设施都为之展开，例如VMA管理、缺页中断、反向映射、页面分配与回收等。struct page数据结构定义在include/linux/mm_types.h头文件中，大量使用了C语言的联合体Union来优化其数据结构的大小，因为每个物理页面都需要一个struct page数据结构，因此管理成本很高。page数据结构的主要成员如下：

```
[include/1inux/mm types.h]
struct page {
	/* First double word block */
	unsigned long flags;		/* Atomic flags, some possibly
					 * updated asynchronously */
	union {
		struct address_space *mapping;	/* If low bit clear, points to
						 * inode address_space, or NULL.
						 * If page mapped as anonymous
						 * memory, low bit is set, and
						 * it points to anon_vma object:
						 * see PAGE_MAPPING_ANON below.
						 */
		void *s_mem;			/* slab first object */
	};

	/* Second double word */
	struct {
		union {
			pgoff_t index;		/* Our offset within mapping. */
			void *freelist;		/* sl[aou]b first free object */
			bool pfmemalloc;	/* If set by the page allocator,
						 * ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS was set
						 * and the low watermark was not
						 * met implying that the system
						 * is under some pressure. The
						 * caller should try ensure
						 * this page is only used to
						 * free other pages.
						 */
		};

		union {
#if defined(CONFIG_HAVE_CMPXCHG_DOUBLE) && \
	defined(CONFIG_HAVE_ALIGNED_STRUCT_PAGE)
			/* Used for cmpxchg_double in slub */
			unsigned long counters;
#else
			/*
			 * Keep _count separate from slub cmpxchg_double data.
			 * As the rest of the double word is protected by
			 * slab_lock but _count is not.
			 */
			unsigned counters;
#endif

			struct {

				union {
					/*
					 * Count of ptes mapped in
					 * mms, to show when page is
					 * mapped & limit reverse map
					 * searches.
					 *
					 * Used also for tail pages
					 * refcounting instead of
					 * _count. Tail pages cannot
					 * be mapped and keeping the
					 * tail page _count zero at
					 * all times guarantees
					 * get_page_unless_zero() will
					 * never succeed on tail
					 * pages.
